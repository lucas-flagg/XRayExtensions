# XRayExtensions
Extensions for Jan Ilavsky's Irena and Nika software for processing of SAXS/WAXS data

 - CHESS G1 metadata support
	Adds support for automatically reading metadata from spec files, as used at several CHESS beamlines for area detectors.
 - Automatic Image Export tool
	Automatically cleans up Nika's displayed 2D images, and saves as PNGs for later browsing.
 - Peak Tagging tools
	Tag peaks in SAXS data to evaluate mesostructures quickly.
 - Dynamic "floating" SDD tools
	Used for custom experiments to accomodate changing instrument geometries across a series of images.
